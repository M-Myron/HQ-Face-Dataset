1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,469
how many times do you think that you've

2
00:00:01,530 --> 00:00:06,989
been lied to today go ahead and take a

3
00:00:04,469 --> 00:00:08,608
guess because the answer might shock you

4
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:10,559
studies show that on the low end that

5
00:00:08,609 --> 00:00:12,359
number is somewhere around 10 times and

6
00:00:10,558 --> 00:00:16,468
on the high end that number could be up

7
00:00:12,359 --> 00:00:17,429
to 200 times in just one day you are

8
00:00:16,469 --> 00:00:19,618
being lied to

9
00:00:17,429 --> 00:00:21,537
constantly what's worse your lie

10
00:00:19,618 --> 00:00:24,718
detection capabilities are definitely

11
00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:28,189
not 100% in fact studies show that they

12
00:00:24,719 --> 00:00:30,959
could be anywhere from 50% wrong to 75%

13
00:00:28,189 --> 00:00:33,149
wrong this video is meant to put the

14
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,500
odds back in your favor because there

15
00:00:33,149 --> 00:00:36,689
are things that you are probably not

16
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:39,179
taught they can help you become a human

17
00:00:36,689 --> 00:00:40,648
lie detector or at least a better one

18
00:00:39,179 --> 00:00:43,169
and I want to cover those four things

19
00:00:40,649 --> 00:00:45,270
plus touch on some examples of some

20
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:47,488
masterful Liars getting caught in the

21
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:49,079
act so let's start with the first thing

22
00:00:47,488 --> 00:00:51,148
that one that everyone wants to know

23
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:53,849
which is what is the body language that

24
00:00:51,149 --> 00:00:55,649
indicate slime no unfortunately there

25
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:57,059
really isn't one thing that is going to

26
00:00:55,649 --> 00:00:58,979
a hundred percent of the time tell you

27
00:00:57,058 --> 00:01:01,498
someone's lime when you're looking to

28
00:00:58,979 --> 00:01:03,959
detect lying in terms of body language

29
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:06,240
what you're looking for are tells of

30
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:08,849
stress with regards to a particular

31
00:01:06,239 --> 00:01:10,739
subject or topic and what that means is

32
00:01:08,849 --> 00:01:12,349
that reading stress in the body is

33
00:01:10,739 --> 00:01:14,489
actually much easier than reading

34
00:01:12,349 --> 00:01:15,898
deception right stress comes through in

35
00:01:14,489 --> 00:01:18,268
a lot of different ways and you can see

36
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:20,640
it in pacifying behaviors so that might

37
00:01:18,269 --> 00:01:22,499
be rubbing of the arm if they're sitting

38
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,390
you can see people rub their leg you'll

39
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:26,490
see people start to touch right here

40
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:28,460
that's a pacifying behavior and went to

41
00:01:26,489 --> 00:01:32,279
meatball - on their lip cross their arms

42
00:01:28,459 --> 00:01:35,668
curse their lips I give you one of those

43
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:37,799
all of these things create lowered like

44
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:41,219
trying to calm yourself down response

45
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:43,859
and we do that in response to stress now

46
00:01:41,219 --> 00:01:45,238
there's one thing that is classic when

47
00:01:43,859 --> 00:01:47,249
people feel stress and it's called

48
00:01:45,239 --> 00:01:49,559
blocking that means putting anything

49
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:52,408
between themselves and the thing that is

50
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:54,688
causing them stress so the classic lying

51
00:01:52,409 --> 00:01:57,149
example of blocking would be this

52
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:59,249
locking the mouth could be covering the

53
00:01:57,149 --> 00:02:00,450
eyes or it could be an object right and

54
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:01,649
right at the time that you're supposed

55
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:03,420
you're asking them if they're lying

56
00:02:01,649 --> 00:02:04,709
they gotta whip their phone out or they

57
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:07,259
simply move something

58
00:02:04,709 --> 00:02:09,329
in between you and them on the desk

59
00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:11,190
blocking is very common and I want to

60
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:12,470
show you two videos of blocking the

61
00:02:11,189 --> 00:02:14,119
first one is a little boy

62
00:02:12,469 --> 00:02:15,558
doing some physical blocking with the

63
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:16,070
hands and the second one is a little

64
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:18,439
girl

65
00:02:16,069 --> 00:02:20,179
moving herself in between an object to

66
00:02:18,439 --> 00:02:28,778
create some distance between her mom who

67
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:28,779
is grilling her who get the paint out

68
00:02:29,199 --> 00:02:40,308
brother did wait let me see it again you

69
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:44,200
didn't do that speak up you still didn't

70
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:44,200
do this I know you did it

71
00:02:45,669 --> 00:02:54,948
Nani now I mentioned earlier that there

72
00:02:52,759 --> 00:02:57,138
isn't just one body language motion that

73
00:02:54,949 --> 00:02:59,359
indicates a lie but actually there is

74
00:02:57,139 --> 00:03:00,319
one that comes close and it is the

75
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:03,590
microexpression

76
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:05,838
of a smile within a story that otherwise

77
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:08,540
doesn't warrant a smile this is called

78
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:11,359
duping delight and what this is first

79
00:03:08,539 --> 00:03:12,829
off a microexpression is when some sort

80
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,600
of expression registers on someone's

81
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:16,249
face for less than a second and is

82
00:03:14,599 --> 00:03:17,987
quickly contained and the reason that

83
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:19,669
this happens is that the part of your

84
00:03:17,989 --> 00:03:22,040
brain that is responsible for emotions

85
00:03:19,669 --> 00:03:23,928
happy sad whatever it is that moves a

86
00:03:22,039 --> 00:03:25,338
fraction of a second faster than the

87
00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:27,708
part of your brain that is responsible

88
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:30,410
for lying so when you tell a lie there's

89
00:03:27,709 --> 00:03:31,1000
actually this visceral joy in getting

90
00:03:30,409 --> 00:03:35,119
away and getting what you want which

91
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,379
registers for second as a smile but then

92
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,820
the part of your brain telling the lie

93
00:03:36,379 --> 00:03:39,829
kicks in it goes don't do that and

94
00:03:37,819 --> 00:03:41,569
quickly shuts it down so it looks

95
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:45,708
something I'll try my best like this

96
00:03:41,569 --> 00:03:47,838
finish the story and then people often

97
00:03:45,709 --> 00:03:49,189
purse their lips so I want to show you a

98
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,959
quick example of that and that's better

99
00:03:49,189 --> 00:03:53,419
than I can do which is again another

100
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:55,069
young girl master liar here who the

101
00:03:53,419 --> 00:03:57,048
context of this is that she wants

102
00:03:55,069 --> 00:03:58,879
attention from her mother and for months

103
00:03:57,049 --> 00:04:01,100
and months and months she has pretended

104
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:02,658
to have these crippling foot cramps so

105
00:04:01,099 --> 00:04:04,849
that her mom will come rub her feet and

106
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:06,798
give her attention pay attention to her

107
00:04:04,849 --> 00:04:09,398
face as soon as her mom starts to touch

108
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:12,109
her feet and she gets what she wants

109
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:13,459
can you give it a rest tongue please

110
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:18,299
let's play cars

111
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:21,129
[Music]

112
00:04:18,298 --> 00:04:22,658
okay if you start to see some tells of

113
00:04:21,129 --> 00:04:24,548
stress maybe some duping delight on

114
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:26,200
someone's face you're going to want to

115
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:28,510
follow up with them verbally and asked

116
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:30,309
very directly hey did you do that thing

117
00:04:28,509 --> 00:04:32,319
that I asked you not to do and in this

118
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:35,229
case you want to listen very carefully

119
00:04:32,319 --> 00:04:37,179
to their verbal response because people

120
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:38,890
don't like to lie and the third thing

121
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:41,229
that will help you catch a liar is that

122
00:04:38,889 --> 00:04:43,539
they often redirect direct questions to

123
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:45,850
some other topic or they have answer

124
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:48,429
them for instance if I go up to someone

125
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:50,080
and I say hey did you take my money they

126
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:52,360
might respond by saying oh my god I'm

127
00:04:50,079 --> 00:04:53,918
not that kind of a person or how could

128
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:55,150
you even ask that of me and then pull

129
00:04:53,918 --> 00:04:57,699
out their phone and immediately block

130
00:04:55,149 --> 00:04:59,649
right these sorts of things are called

131
00:04:57,699 --> 00:05:02,229
redirects do they immediately indicate

132
00:04:59,649 --> 00:05:04,568
guilt absolutely not but what we find in

133
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:06,579
Liars is that they try to tell as much

134
00:05:04,569 --> 00:05:07,479
of the truth as possible until they are

135
00:05:06,579 --> 00:05:10,029
pushed to the brink

136
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:12,310
will they flat-out lie absolutely but

137
00:05:10,029 --> 00:05:14,469
sometimes they'll even add qualifiers on

138
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:16,418
the end of their denials so I say hey

139
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:17,380
did you take my money they'll go no I

140
00:05:16,418 --> 00:05:19,329
didn't take your money out of your

141
00:05:17,379 --> 00:05:20,888
wallet when really they took money off

142
00:05:19,329 --> 00:05:22,989
of the kitchen table or whatever it was

143
00:05:20,889 --> 00:05:25,209
so I've got another video here the

144
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:27,190
context is that there's this young boy

145
00:05:25,209 --> 00:05:28,899
who has clearly made a mess and his dad

146
00:05:27,189 --> 00:05:30,789
asked him did you know who did this and

147
00:05:28,899 --> 00:05:31,209
he answers a completely different

148
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:33,580
question

149
00:05:31,209 --> 00:05:35,499
it seems exaggerated but the truth is

150
00:05:33,579 --> 00:05:37,869
kids have the same strategies as adults

151
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:41,168
we are just better at masking them and

152
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:43,089
telling more elaborate stories you know

153
00:05:41,168 --> 00:05:45,988
what happened I guess you were

154
00:05:43,089 --> 00:05:50,228
stretching haha how did the Temne fall I

155
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:53,890
can put it back up how did it fall how

156
00:05:50,228 --> 00:05:55,989
did it fall I believe you but what

157
00:05:53,889 --> 00:05:58,119
happened so at this point let's say that

158
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:59,619
you've seen a tell maybe you've seen

159
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:01,120
that duping delight when asked they've

160
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:03,610
said how could you even ask that of me

161
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:05,530
now you're kind of put in a pickle so

162
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:07,690
when it comes down to it you can always

163
00:06:05,529 --> 00:06:09,759
go at that listen I'm having a hard time

164
00:06:07,689 --> 00:06:11,769
understanding what happened can you tell

165
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:14,379
me and then the fourth thing that you're

166
00:06:11,769 --> 00:06:16,749
looking for is to see if this person can

167
00:06:14,379 --> 00:06:20,468
recreate the events of what actually

168
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:21,879
happened out of sequential order liars

169
00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:24,460
whether they're making it up on the spot

170
00:06:21,879 --> 00:06:25,688
or they've rehearsed it often have done

171
00:06:24,459 --> 00:06:27,427
this before and they've done

172
00:06:25,689 --> 00:06:29,349
chronologically right so it can make

173
00:06:27,428 --> 00:06:31,418
sense chronologically but when you ask

174
00:06:29,348 --> 00:06:33,367
them so wait a second how is the money

175
00:06:31,418 --> 00:06:34,868
over here at the end and then when did

176
00:06:33,369 --> 00:06:36,909
you walk into the room and what happened

177
00:06:34,869 --> 00:06:39,819
later when you take them out of order

178
00:06:36,908 --> 00:06:42,158
you can oftentimes trip them up so of

179
00:06:39,819 --> 00:06:43,569
course another little example a fun one

180
00:06:42,158 --> 00:06:45,307
here which is really easy to bust cuz

181
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:46,539
he's a five year old boy here's a boy

182
00:06:45,309 --> 00:06:49,059
who took cookies out of the cookie jar

183
00:06:46,538 --> 00:06:51,757
and blamed it on the dog and watch as

184
00:06:49,059 --> 00:06:52,478
the story unravels as different elements

185
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:56,278
don't add up

186
00:06:52,478 --> 00:06:56,277
did she get the cookies upstairs

187
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:11,020
I know I wasn't locked in here how did

188
00:07:03,529 --> 00:07:14,509
she open the lid tell herself baby see

189
00:07:11,019 --> 00:07:15,438
often get left her teeth she opened the

190
00:07:14,509 --> 00:07:18,259
lid with her teeth

191
00:07:15,439 --> 00:07:20,318
yeah then she ate some cookies how did

192
00:07:18,259 --> 00:07:24,308
she put the lid back on

193
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:28,629
she jumped on it she jumped on the bowl

194
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:30,919
of cookies to put the lid back on so

195
00:07:28,629 --> 00:07:34,008
there you have it that is how we spot a

196
00:07:30,918 --> 00:07:35,328
master liar of any age now obviously I

197
00:07:34,009 --> 00:07:36,799
had some fun picking out the videos

198
00:07:35,329 --> 00:07:38,659
today they entertained me and I hope

199
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:41,479
they entertain you as well but the truth

200
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:43,280
is kids and adults lie in the same way

201
00:07:41,478 --> 00:07:45,289
so the same four things that I gave you

202
00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:47,359
today will work across the age group

203
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:50,270
first off you're paying attention for

204
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:52,669
any sort of pacifying or blocking

205
00:07:50,269 --> 00:07:54,259
behavior with regards to a specific

206
00:07:52,668 --> 00:07:55,849
subject if it differs from their

207
00:07:54,259 --> 00:07:58,149
baseline and all of a sudden they start

208
00:07:55,850 --> 00:08:01,040
blocking or pacifying pay more attention

209
00:07:58,149 --> 00:08:03,227
second duping delay that is the quick

210
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:05,059
flash and then the containment of a

211
00:08:03,228 --> 00:08:08,718
smile with a story that shouldn't have a

212
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:10,279
smile on it third difficulty in outright

213
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:13,099
denying that they did something wrong

214
00:08:10,279 --> 00:08:15,109
any sort of verbal jujitsu that means

215
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:16,789
you need to dig deeper and then of

216
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:18,650
course fourth you're paying attention to

217
00:08:16,788 --> 00:08:20,808
see if they can reconstruct their

218
00:08:18,649 --> 00:08:22,218
version of events outside of

219
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:24,169
chronological order if they think about

220
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:27,410
it here it's fine but it needs to make a

221
00:08:24,168 --> 00:08:28,488
logical consistent sense so hope that

00:08:27,410 --> 00:08:30,350
